SUMMARY: VPN BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS

VPN Benefits:
- Masks real IP and location.
- Encrypts all internet traffic (useful on public Wi-Fi).
- Helps bypass censorship and geo-blocking.
- Prevents ISP from monitoring browsing activities.
- Provides strong security with modern encryption protocols.

VPN Limitations:
- Free plans have limited servers and reduced speeds.
- VPN does not guarantee complete anonymity (cookies, logins still track).
- Some websites block VPN IPs.
- Browsing speed slightly reduced due to encryption overhead.
